Find the Word Games

1. Set Up Your VPC
Create a VPC: Use the AWS Management Console to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets, route tables, and an Internet Gateway.
Subnets: Create public and private subnets. Public subnets can host resources that need internet access (like load balancers), while private subnets can host application servers.

2. Deploy EC2 Instances
Launch EC2 Instances: Launch instances in the private subnet for your application servers.
Install Software: SSH into your instances and install the necessary software (like a web server or application runtime).

3. Set Up a Load Balancer
Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB): This will distribute incoming traffic across your EC2 instances.
Target Groups: Configure target groups for your EC2 instances.

4. Configure Auto Scaling
Auto Scaling Group: Create an Auto Scaling group to manage the EC2 instances. Define scaling policies based on CPU usage or other metrics.
Launch Configuration: Define a launch configuration that specifies the AMI, instance type, and other settings for the instances in the Auto Scaling group.

5. Set Up DynamoDB
Create a DynamoDB Table: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to create a DynamoDB table for your application data.
Configure IAM Roles: Set up roles and policies to allow your application to access the DynamoDB table.

6. Integrate Jenkins
Set Up Jenkins: Deploy Jenkins on an EC2 instance in the public subnet or use AWS CodeBuild/CodePipeline.
Install Plugins: Install necessary plugins (like GitHub, AWS, etc.).
Configure Jenkins: Create a job in Jenkins that pulls code from your GitHub repository and deploys it to your EC2 instances.

7. Connect GitHub to Jenkins
Webhook Setup: Set up a GitHub webhook that triggers the Jenkins job on push events to your repository.

8. Lambda Functions
Create Lambda Functions: If your application has microservices or specific tasks that can be executed serverlessly, create Lambda functions.
IAM Roles: Ensure Lambda functions have the appropriate permissions to access DynamoDB and other services.

9. Security Groups and IAM
Security Groups: Configure security groups to control access to your EC2 instances, load balancer, and Lambda functions.
IAM Roles: Set up roles for your EC2 instances and Lambda functions to grant permissions to access other AWS resources.

10. Testing and Monitoring
Test Your Setup: Deploy your application and test the complete flow from GitHub to Jenkins to EC2.
CloudWatch: Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor your resources and set up alarms for scaling and health checks.

11. Continuous Deployment
CI/CD Pipeline: Utilize Jenkins to create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys your application whenever changes are pushed to GitHub.

Example Workflow

Code is pushed to GitHub.
The GitHub webhook triggers a Jenkins job.
Jenkins pulls the latest code and builds the application.
Jenkins deploys the new version to EC2 instances using the Auto Scaling group.
Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic to the healthy EC2 instances.
Application interacts with DynamoDB for data storage.
